## Create New Transaction

1. Validate the various Ids and then apply session for the transaction. A session is required for transactions in MongoDB because it's the mechanism that groups multiple operations into a single, atomic unit of workâ€”meaning either all operations succeed, or none do.

2. Make sure the transaction does not exist in the database. If it exists, the error message will be "Transaction with this ID already exists".

3. Create transaction object and a new Mongoose model instance called newTransaction using the Transaction model and populating it with data from transactionObject. 

4. Find the order using the order id from the frontend

5. If the transactionType is "Payout" and an order exists, then update the order's transaction field with the ID of the new transaction, and save the order within the current session (to maintain atomicity).
